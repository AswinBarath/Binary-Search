/*
 * Problem Description
 * Given 2 integers A and B and an array of integers C of size N. Element C[i]
 * represents the length of ith board.
 * You have to paint all N boards [C0, C1, C2, C3 â€¦ CN-1]. There are A painters
 * available and each of them takes B units of time to paint 1 unit of the
 * board.
 * 
 * Calculate and return the minimum time required to paint all boards under the
 * constraints that any painter will only paint contiguous sections of the
 * board.
 * NOTE:
 * 1. 2 painters cannot share a board to paint. That is to say, a board cannot
 * be painted partially by one painter, and partially by another.
 * 2. A painter will only paint contiguous boards. This means a configuration
 * where painter 1 paints boards 1 and 3 but not 2 is invalid.
 * 
 * Return the ans % 10000003.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Problem Constraints
 * 1 <= A <= 1000
 * 1 <= B <= 106
 * 1 <= N <= 105
 * 1 <= C[i] <= 106
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input Format
 * The first argument given is the integer A.
 * The second argument given is the integer B.
 * The third argument given is the integer array C.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Output Format
 * Return minimum time required to paint all boards under the constraints that
 * any painter will only paint contiguous sections of board % 10000003.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example Input
 * Input 1:
 * 
 * A = 2
 * B = 5
 * C = [1, 10]
 * Input 2:
 * 
 * A = 10
 * B = 1
 * C = [1, 8, 11, 3]
 * 
 * 
 * Example Output
 * Output 1:
 * 
 * 50
 * Output 2:
 * 
 * 11
 * 
 * 
 * Example Explanation
 * Explanation 1:
 * 
 * Possibility 1:- One painter paints both blocks, time taken = 55 units.
 * Possibility 2:- Painter 1 paints block 1, painter 2 paints block 2, time take
 * = max(5, 50) = 50
 * There are no other distinct ways to paint boards.
 * ans = 50 % 10000003
 * Explanation 2:
 * 
 * Each block is painted by a painter so, Painter 1 paints block 1, painter 2
 * paints block 2, painter 3 paints block 3
 * and painter 4 paints block 4, time taken = max(1, 8, 11, 3) = 11
 * ans = 11 % 10000003
